# Weather Forecasting with Python

## Overview
Welcome to my weather forecasting project! 🌤️ In this repository, I’ve built a Python program that predicts temperature trends using real historical data from the Daily Delhi Climate dataset. Whether you’re a data enthusiast, a curious learner, or someone planning outdoor events, this project has something for you.

## Features
- **Temperature Trends** : The program captures fluctuations, seasonal variations, and long-term patterns.
- **Interactive Visualizations** : Thanks to Plotly, you can explore the data dynamically.
- **Easy-to-Use**: Follow the steps in the video tutorial to get started.

## Installation
- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Install the required libraries:
  pip install numpy matplotlib prophet plotly

## Run the program:
python weather_predictor.py

## Data
I used the Daily Delhi Climate dataset (DailyDelhiClimateTrain.csv), focusing solely on temperature. You can find the dataset in the data directory.

## Usage
Clean and preprocess the data (if needed).
Train the Prophet model on historical temperature data.
Project temperature conditions for the next year.

## Contributions
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues, submit pull requests, or share your insights.


Let’s make temperature forecasting accessible to everyone! 🌎📊 Feel free to explore the code and contribute. Happy coding! 🚀🔍
